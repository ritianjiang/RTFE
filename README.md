# RTFE

## Intro

It's a package to extract features from DNA sequence.
It has implemented some methods like:

        PSTNP; EIIP; Chaos Game
        
The package is designed for another package: [**p6mA**](https://github.com/Konglab404/p6mA/), which is a 
package for predicting 
N^6-methyladenines.

I didn't write document or tiny vigenette yet, maybe one day I'll add them.
